                    I have a variety of work experience, however none 
                    of which are related to programming or computer science. 
                    The jobs I have done so far have mainly just been part time jobs. 
                    As of now, my resume doesnâ€™t include any of my programming skills or projects, 
                    mainly just soft skills. So in the future 
                    I am looking to populate my resume with future projects and skills I have.
                </p>
