                Two projects I have completed in the past were a circuit that activated a fan using a motion detector, 
                and a tetris clone. For the circuit I used python on a raspberry pi with the RPI.gpio library. 
                I created my tetris clone using c++ with the SDL library for rendering. However none of these projects are 
                contained in my github, for the tetris game I had made long ago before I used github and I had lost the files, 
                and the program for my circuit was stored onto my raspberry pi which I no longer own. 
                In the future I wish to focus on more web development projects as I have none.
