                    My name is Jayden Thung. I'm a 20 year old computing science student at SFU. 
                    This is currently my second semester at SFU as Iâ€™m a transfer student from another institution. 
                    When I graduate from SFU my goal is to hopefully become a full time software engineer. In order to become a software engineer 
                    I plan to build a variety of projects in the future and try to learn as many new applicable skills 
                    as possible. Besides school, I have a variety of hobbies and interests I participate in such as 
                    reading manga and playing badminton 
                </p>
